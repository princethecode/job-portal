# Android Job Portal App - Integration Updates

This package contains the latest updates to the Android Job Portal App, focusing on the integration between the Android app and the backend API.

## What's Included

### Network Layer
- `ApiClient.java` - Handles API requests and authentication
- `ApiService.java` - Interface defining all API endpoints
- `ApiCallback.java` - Interface for handling API responses

### Model Classes
- `ApiResponse.java` - Generic response wrapper
- `User.java` - User model
- `LoginRequest.java` - Login request model
- `RegisterRequest.java` - Registration request model

### Updated UI Components
- `LoginActivity.java` - Now integrated with the API client

## Integration Overview

The network layer is designed to connect the Android app with the backend Laravel API. The `ApiClient` class handles all API requests, including authentication, user registration, profile management, and other interactions. The `ApiService` interface defines all the API endpoints, and the model classes provide the data structures for requests and responses.

The UI components have been updated to use the API client for authentication and data retrieval. The `LoginActivity` now uses the `ApiClient` to authenticate users and handle login responses.

## How to Use

1. Copy the network, models, and updated auth files to your Android project
2. Make sure to update the `BASE_URL` in `ApiClient.java` to point to your backend API
3. Add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.9'
```

## Next Steps

The next steps in the development process will be:
1. Complete the integration of all UI components with the API client
2. Implement the dashboard and job listing screens
3. Add job application functionality
4. Test the entire system end-to-end
5. Fix any issues that arise during testing
